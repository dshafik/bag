# Roadmap

The following is a list of features that we want to implement before we consider the library to be stable. This list is subject to change and is not exhaustive.

- [ ] Add support for multiple mappers on a single class or property
- [x] Add support for a simple Object -> Bag trait ([Docs](object-to-bag))
- [x] Add support for wrapping a Bag when transforming to an array/JSON ([Docs](wrapping))
- [ ] Add support for filling data from Laravel route parameters
- [x] Add support for computed values
