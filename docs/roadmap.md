# Roadmap

The following is a list of features that we want to implement before we consider the library to be stable. This list is subject to change and is not exhaustive.

- [x] Add support for multiple mappers on a single class or property
- [x] Add support for a simple Object -> Bag trait ([Docs](object-to-bag))
- [x] Add support for wrapping a Bag when transforming to an array/JSON ([Docs](wrapping))
- [x] Add support for filling data from Laravel route parameters ([Docs](laravel-route-parameter-binding))
- [x] Add support for computed values ([Docs](computed-properties))
