## What is Bag?

Bag helps you create immutable value objects. It's a great way to encapsulate data within your application.

Bag prioritizes immutability and type safety with built-in validation and data casting.

### When should I use Value Objects?

Value objects should be used in place of regular arrays, allowing you enforce type safety and immutability.

### Does it work with Laravel/Symfony/Other Framework?

Bag is framework-agnostic, but it works great with Laravel. Bag uses standard Laravel [Collections](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/collections) and [Validation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/validation). 
In addition, it will automatically inject `Bag\Bag` value objects into your controllers with validation.
